# 🧠 Level-2-Task-3-Unsupervised-Learning-with-K-means Clustering

## 📘 **Project Overview**

This project explores **unsupervised machine learning** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to uncover hidden patterns and group data points based on their similarities.
Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data — meaning the model must identify structure and relationships without predefined categories.

Through this project, I demonstrate the complete process of clustering — from data preprocessing and feature scaling to determining the optimal number of clusters and visualizing the results for meaningful insights.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

The main goal of this project is to apply **K-Means clustering** to identify natural groupings within a dataset.
Specific objectives include:

1. To perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** for clustering readiness.
2. To **standardize and scale features** to ensure fair distance calculations.
3. To determine the **optimal number of clusters** using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
4. To **implement and train a K-Means model** on the dataset.
5. To **visualize and interpret** the resulting clusters for actionable insights.
